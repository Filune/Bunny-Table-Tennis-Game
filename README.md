# Bunny-Table-Tennis
A sweet table tennis game made with PyGame! It was made during my studies at KTH.

# How do I run the game?
In order to run this game, you'll need to have Python 3.8 (or higher) & PyGame module installed.

Execute these commands in the terminal in order to download the necessary dependencies:
1. `apt-get install python3.8`
2. `apt-get install python-pygame` OR `python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user`

You're now ready to compile the game. Download the entire project folder & compile `bunny_game.py`. Compiling is simple, just `cd` via the terminal to the downloaded folder & execute `python3 bunny_game.py`.

# How do I edit the AI?
In order to edit the AI, edit `bunny_game.py`. Head over to the "game" function, and then the subfunction "AIMovement". Edit away as you please, and then save & compile.
